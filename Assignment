Your task is to create a basic flight search and booking system with the following requirements:
1. Frontend:
- Implement a search form for users to input origin, destination, and travel dates.
- Display search results with flight options.
- Create a simple booking form to capture passenger details and payment information.
2. Backend:
- Develop RESTful APIs to handle search requests and bookings.
- Implement mock flight data (no need for real-time data integration).
- Store booking information securely.
3. Security Requirements:
- Implement secure user authentication and authorization.
- Ensure all data transmissions are encrypted.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Handle and store sensitive information (e.g., payment details).
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information.
- Add basic logging for auditing purposes.
4. Additional Considerations:
- Follow GDPR/ PDPA principles for handling user data.
- Implement basic role-based access control.
- Consider scalability in your design.
